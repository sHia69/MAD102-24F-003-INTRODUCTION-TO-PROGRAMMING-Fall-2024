\section{Introduction to Inheritance}
Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class, promoting code reuse and modularity. The class that inherits is known as the \textbf{derived class}, while the class it inherits from is the \textbf{base class}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Benefits of Inheritance}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Reduces redundancy by reusing code across multiple classes.
            \item Allows for updates in the base class to automatically reflect in derived classes.
            \item Simplifies the code structure by promoting a hierarchical organization.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Class Hierarchy}
Inheritance creates a \textbf{class hierarchy}, which models relationships in the form of parent and child classes.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Parent (Base) Class}: Provides attributes and methods to be inherited by child classes.
    \item \textbf{Child (Derived) Class}: Inherits attributes and methods from the parent class and can introduce its own methods.
\end{itemize}

For example:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("Some generic animal sound")

class Dog(Animal):  # Dog is a derived class of Animal
    def speak(self):
        print("Woof Woof")
\end{lstlisting}

In this example, \texttt{Dog} inherits from \texttt{Animal} and overrides the \texttt{speak} method.

\section{Overriding Methods}
A derived class can redefine or \textbf{override} a method inherited from the base class. This enables the derived class to provide a specialized behavior.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("Some generic animal sound")

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print("Meow")
        
animal = Animal()
animal.speak()  # Outputs: Some generic animal sound

cat = Cat()
cat.speak()     # Outputs: Meow
\end{lstlisting}

Here, the \texttt{Cat} class overrides the \texttt{speak} method from \texttt{Animal} to provide a custom implementation.

\section{Multiple Inheritance}
In Python, a class can inherit from multiple base classes, which is called \textbf{multiple inheritance}. This is useful when a class needs features from more than one base class.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
class Walker:
    def walk(self):
        print("Walking on two legs")

class Flyer:
    def fly(self):
        print("Flying with wings")

class Bird(Walker, Flyer):  # Bird inherits from both Walker and Flyer
    pass

sparrow = Bird()
sparrow.walk()  # Outputs: Walking on two legs
sparrow.fly()   # Outputs: Flying with wings
\end{lstlisting}

The \texttt{Bird} class inherits methods from both \texttt{Walker} and \texttt{Flyer}.

\section{Mixins}
\textbf{Mixins} are classes used to extend the functionality of a class by providing additional methods. They are not intended to be standalone and are usually used with multiple inheritance.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
class StuntMixin:
    def jump(self, distance):
        print(f"Jumped {distance} meters!")

class CarefulMixin:
    def caution(self):
        print("Proceeding with caution.")

class DirtBike(StuntMixin, CarefulMixin):
    pass

dirt_bike = DirtBike()
dirt_bike.jump(10)       # Outputs: Jumped 10 meters!
dirt_bike.caution()       # Outputs: Proceeding with caution.
\end{lstlisting}

The \texttt{DirtBike} class uses \texttt{StuntMixin} and \texttt{CarefulMixin} to gain additional capabilities.


\section{Extended Python Code Example}
Below is an extended example of inheritance and mixins, combining all of the above concepts into a more complex class structure.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
# Base class
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, current_speed=0):
        self.current_speed = current_speed
    
    def description(self):
        print(f"Traveling at {self.current_speed} km/h")
    
    def make_noise(self):
        print("Vroom Vroom")

# Derived class inheriting from Vehicle
class Bicycle(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self, has_basket=False):
        super().__init__(0)
        self.has_basket = has_basket
    
    def description(self):
        super().description()
        print("But in the bike lane!")
    
    def make_noise(self):
        print("Ring Ring")

# Mixins for additional functionality
class StuntMixin:
    def jump(self, distance):
        print(f"Jumped {distance} meters!")
    
    def skid(self, distance):
        print(f"Skidded {distance} meters!")

class CarefulMixin:
    def avoid_obstacles(self):
        print("Carefully avoiding obstacles.")

# Multiple inheritance with Bicycle and mixins
class DirtBike(Bicycle, StuntMixin, CarefulMixin):
    def __init__(self, has_basket=False):
        super().__init__(has_basket)
    
    def make_noise(self):
        print("Braaaap")

# Demonstration of class functionality
car = Vehicle()
car.description()
car.make_noise()

bike = Bicycle(has_basket=True)
bike.description()
bike.make_noise()

dirt_bike = DirtBike()
dirt_bike.jump(5)
dirt_bike.skid(2)
dirt_bike.avoid_obstacles()
dirt_bike.current_speed = 20
dirt_bike.description()
dirt_bike.make_noise()
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Vehicle}: The base class that provides a description and make\_noise methods.
    \item \textbf{Bicycle}: A derived class that inherits from Vehicle, overriding the \texttt{make\_noise} method and extending \texttt{description}.
    \item \textbf{StuntMixin} and \textbf{CarefulMixin}: Provide additional capabilities to the DirtBike class.
    \item \textbf{DirtBike}: Combines all features of Vehicle, Bicycle, and the mixins to create a versatile class with multiple behaviors.
\end{itemize}

\newpage 

\section{Class Exercise}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a program that will store a list of contacts
    \item There are three types of contacts
    \item A person with a name and phone number
    \item A student with a name, a phone number, and the school they attend
    \item An employee with a name, a phone number, and the place they work
    \item A student is a person and an employee is also a person.
    \end{itemize}
The program will ask what type of contact to enter, and will continually ask until the user says they are done. Then it will display all the contacts entered.
\begin{itemize}
          \item If the contact is a person – it will display their name and phone number
          \item If the contact is a student – it will display their name and phone number and then the
          school they attend
          \item If the contact is an employee – it will display their work place followed by their name and
          phone number 
\end{itemize}
